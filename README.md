# Safesend


**Website Repository. Python API in seperate repo.

In a world full of unknown online dangers, Safesend is supposed 
to be a safe haven for the youth. It allows kids to chat with each 
other while preventing hateful messages / explicit content from being 
sent.All messages are sent to a FastAPI API which runs any text through 
a hate-speech detection model and any media through an explicit content
detection model.
